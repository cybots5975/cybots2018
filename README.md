# OpenFTC-app-turbo is to be used at your own risk.

OpenFTC-app is currently based on version 3.5 of the SDK. Do not attempt to manually update beyond that yourself. OpenFTC will be updated within a week of new official app releases.

The OpenFTC documentation is still under construction.

OpenFTC-app-turbo removes the OnBotJava and Blocks programming systems for teams that don't use them, speeding up deploy time drastically. If you use these systems, please see [OpenFTC-app](https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenFTC-app).

The OpenFTC family of Robot Controller apps are based on the official
[FTC SDK](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app) (Software Development Kit), but the AAR files it uses have been converted to modules in the Android Studio project. This makes it easy to see and modify almost the entirety of the SDK's source code. In addition, the history in Git shows all changes that have been made to the core code since OpenFTC's inception. This is a very useful supplement to the changelogs that FIRST provides - teams can see exactly what code has been changed and how it will affect them.

This system allows pull requests and enhancements to the code of the entire SDK, and can allow teams to understand the structure and functionality of the whole system. Most enhancements will likely be accepted as long as they _do not force teams to change their workflow._ Changes made in the OpenFTC SDK should allow teams to move from the official SDK to OpenFTC-app with no code changes required.

To request a new feature, you can open an issue on this repository. If there's a large enough call for the feature, it's very likely to be added to the list for a future release. 

This version keeps the OnBotJava and Blocks programming system. If your team doesn't use these, you may want to look into [OpenFTC-app-turbo](https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenFTC-app-turbo), which helps to decrease deploy times.
