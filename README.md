# OpenRC-turbo is to be used at your own risk.
##### While every change is made with care not to break anything, FIRST has NOT tested our modifications.
##### Volunteers at competitions may be less willing to assist you if you use OpenRC.
The OpenFTC community (which created OpenRC) is very helpful, so please create an issue or talk to us on Discord if you
encounter any problems.

OpenRC is currently based on version 3.6 of the SDK. Do not attempt to manually update beyond that yourself. OpenRC will
be updated within a week of new official app releases.

The OpenRC documentation is still under construction.

OpenRC-turbo removes the OnBotJava and Blocks programming systems for teams that don't use them, speeding up deploy time
by removing the large files required for those systems. If you use these systems, please see
[the standard version of OpenRC](https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenRC).

The OpenRC family of Robot Controller apps are brought to you by the OpenFTC community. They are based on the official
[FTC SDK](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app) (Software Development Kit), but the AAR files used there have been
converted to first-class modules in the OpenRC Android Studio project. This makes it easy to see and modify almost the
entirety of the Robot Controller app's source code. In addition, the history in Git shows all changes that have been
made to the core code since OpenRC's inception. This is a very useful supplement to the changelogs that FIRST provides -
teams can see exactly what code has been changed and determine how those changes will affect them.
This system allows pull requests and enhancements to the code of the entire SDK, and can allow teams to understand the
structure and functionality of the whole system. Enhancements will be considered as long as they _do not force teams to
change their workflow._ Changes made in the OpenRC should keep it possible for teams to move from the official SDK to
OpenRC with no code changes required.

To request a new feature, you can open an issue on this repository. If there's a large enough call for the feature, it's
very likely to be added to the list for a future release.

# Release Notes
To see the release notes for FIRST's releases of this SDK, see [doc/FIRST_CHANGELOG.md](doc/FIRST_CHANGELOG.md)

## 2.0 beta 2
* CRITICAL BUG FIX: The app wouldn't automatically restart when it ought to. Now it will.
* Updated Gradle from version 4.1 to version 4.5
* Updated the ancient Gradle Wrapper
* Tiny text fixes

## 2.0 beta 1
* Renamed from OpenFTC-app and OpenFTC-app-turbo to OpenRC and OpenRC-turbo. OpenFTC is now solely the name of the team
  and community that develops these apps and others.
* ‎Added stockDebug build configuration that will build an app without any of the OpenFTC modifications enabled
* ‎Large deployment time improvements for both Turbo and Full variants (accomplished by pushing Vuforia once from a new
  Gradle task, instead of every time bundled inside the APK)
* ‎Added an easy way to keep your Vuforia key off of GitHub (which would violate the Vuforia Developer Agreement)
* ‎Fix for Instant Run (It's recommended that you continue to leave instant run turned off in the Android Studio
  settings. In addition, be aware that changes applied with the instant run lightning bolt button may not persist when
  you restart the app.)
* ‎Updated to version 3.6 of the official RC app
* Migrated to version 3 of the Android Gradle plugin (Android Studio 3.0 or later is now required)
* ‎Ran Android Studio's formatting tool on the entire project. If you made any changes to files outside of TeamCode, you
  will almost certainly have merge conflicts because of this.
* ‎Show OpenRC version on about screen
* ‎Added splash screen
* ‎Removed all Vuforia targets except for the VuMarks used in Relic Recovery (for additional size reduction and lower
  deployment times)
* Show OpenRC version when the robot controller inspection screen is viewed from the driver station

## 1.1
* Updated the app to be based on version 3.5 of the official SDK.

## Pre-1.1
* Extracted the aar files and associated source jars into full, easily changed source code modules.
* Warn user if the driver station app is installed on the device
* Fixed bug with log viewer colorization
* Add option that allows the user to choose whether lines should wrap in the log viewer (they don't by default now)
* Changed the icon to make the app more easily distinguishable from the official one
* Added the OpenFTC version to the main screen
* Added "About OpenFTC" button to the about screen
* Allowed Gradle to use more RAM (up to 2GB) for faster build times
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turbo-specific changes
* Initial Turbo release that removes the Blocks and OnBotJava features

## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a *FIRST* Tech Challenge
competition robot.  To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer. If you are new to the
*FIRST* Tech Challenge software and control system, you should visit the online wiki to learn how to install, configure,
and use the software and control system:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/wiki

Note that the wiki is an "evergreen" document that is constantly being updated and edited.  It contains the most current
information about the *FIRST* Tech Challenge software and control system.

## Downloading the Project
It is important to note that this repository is large and can take a long time and use a lot of space to download. If
you would like to save time and space, there are some options that you can choose to download only the most current
version of the Android project folder:

* If you are a git user, *FIRST* recommends that you use the --depth command line argument to only clone the most
current version of the repository:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app.git`

* Or, if you prefer, you can use the "Download Zip" button available through the main repository page.  Downloading the
project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder
("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").

## Getting Help
