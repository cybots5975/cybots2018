# DogeCV
A easy to use computer vision library used for FTC Games to detect game objects. Based on Ender CV and OpenCV. 


# DISCLAIMER
### THIS REPO IS STILL UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT. I WILL BE ADDING FURTHER DOCUMENTATION, BUG FIXES AND NEW DETECTORS SOON. MANY OF THE 
However, although many of the detectors are currently pretty basic, I am putting alot of time in effort into this lib, and open sourced it to let the community work or learn from my mistakes. This is the exact code my team will be running so I do have a decent motivation to work on it ;)

- Motion Tracking for Cryptobox
- Cryptobox line checks follow lines instead of Y-Axis
